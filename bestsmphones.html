    <div id="para">
        <p><b><center>When it comes to smartphones it seems like there are literally thousands of phones that claim to be the best one ( And that is true )! To make it easy for you to choose the right ones, we have come up with our top 3 smartphones to buy in 2021. They are decided based on price, performance, battery life, and extra features. Without further ado, let’s dive in!</center></b></p>
        <h2><center style="font-size: 40px;">iPhone 12</center></h2>
        <img src="iphone12final.png" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; margin-left: 460px;"/>
        <p><b>The iPhone 12, which Apple rolled out on October 23 of 2020, is one of the best performing phones in its class. It has 5G Cellular Capabilities and since it is powered by the newest A14 Bionic Chip, it has the best chip put into a smartphone to the time of writing this blog. With a beautiful edge to edge Super Retina XDR Display ( Coming in options for 5.4 or 6.1 inches ), this makes the screen and light quality no issue. And for durability, there is a strong ceramic shield, strong aluminum frame, and a very good protection against water, with a maximum depth of 6 meters up to 30 minutes. While it has only 2 cameras on it, there are one of the best cameras in the industry. It is also compatible with wireless charging and MagSafe cases and wallets. There are 2 SIM card slots, there is the physical SIM card and eSIM. It comes in 64, 128, and 256 GB of Storage to choose from. Some other features are that there’s Face ID and that it is compatible with fast charging and charges to 50% in 30 minutes. Priced at $799 USD ( $699 for the Mini Version ), it is quite pricey, but it beats the competition in terms of the performance.</b></p>
        <h2><center style="font-size: 40px;">Google Pixel 4a 5G</center></h2>
        <img src="pixel4a5gfinal.png" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; margin-left: 460px;"/>
        <p><b>Similar to the iPhone 12, the Pixel 4a 5G has 5G Cellular Capabilities ( Hence the name ), which also has a nicely sized 6.2 inch OLED Display at 1080p. It has 3 cameras on the back, and a powerful 3885 mAh battery. There are only 2 storage options to choose from, 128 GB and 256 GB. And to note, it has a headphone jack which many companies have been removing from their newest phones. It also has 2 microphones and stereo speakers for the most clear audio. The phone’s battery can also keep it going for 48 hours! This immediately knocks Google’s closest competitors, like Samsung and Apple, out of the park. With the Titan M Chip, your privacy is more secure than ever with this phone, and they guarantee a minimum of 3 years worth of OS and Security Updates, meaning that it will never run out anytime soon. Some other features worth noting is that it has an adaptive battery, meaning it learns what are your most used apps and reduces the power to ones you don’t use as often, to keep the battery running longer. It also senses that if you have been in a car accident, and immediately calls 911 for your safety at an instant. Finally, it has the dual sim card slots, with a nano Sim and an eSIM. Fairly priced at $499 compared to other smartphones.</b></p>
        <h2><center style="font-size: 40px;">OnePlus 9</center></h2>
        <img src="oneplus9final.png" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; margin-left: 460px;"/>
        <p><b><center>The OnePlus 9 is fairly new to the competition, but has already made a profound impact in the industry. It has 5g Cellular Capabilities, precision cameras on the back developed in cooperation with Hasselblad, both are made by Sony, along with a camera on the front. It has a 6.55 inch large OLED Display, and it’s 4500 mAh Battery can go from 0 - 100% in less than 30 minutes! This immediately rivals Apple and Google in terms of how fast it is charged. It has a very powerful Snapdragon 888 CPU and a fluid 120 Hz Display. The newest and most exciting innovation of their phone is the amazing OxygenOS 11. It is similar to android and has easy to use functionality. To summarize, it is superior greatly in battery life, and it is at the level of the other competitors, starting at a price of $729. </center></b></p>

        <h2><center style="font-size: 40px;">Asus ROG Phone 3 5G: Gaming</center></h2>
        <img src="AsusROG3final.png" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; margin-left: 460px;"/>
        <p><center><b>ROG Phone 3 is the most powerful gaming phone to use the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon™865 Plus 5G Mobile Platform with advanced 5G1 mobile communications capabilities. Built to satisfy even the most hardcore gamer, it has an amazing new 144 Hz / 1 ms display that leaves the competition standing. Alongside upgraded features like AirTrigger 3, you'll find everything you loved about the previous generation, including a monster 6000 mAh battery2, the unique side-charging design, dual front-facing speakers, and a full range of modular accessories. ROG Phone 3 sets the new standard for mobile gaming! It contains the latest LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.1 ROM, ROG Phone 3 delivers the ultimate in overall performance and gives you a super-smooth gaming experience. The GameCool 3 cooling system in ROG Phone 3 uses an advanced 3D vapor chamber and a large heat sink that are precisely located to eliminate hotspots. The cooling system is incredibly effective at removing heat during full-speed operation via its specially designed vents. All in all, this is one of the most extraordinary phones we have ever seen. It comes for a quite hefty price of $900.</b></center></p>
        <h2><center style="font-size: 40px;">PinePhone: Coding</center></h2>
        <img src="pinephonefinal.png" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; margin-left: 460px;"/>
        <p><center><b>The new pinephone beta has a microSIM card slot for it with a screen that has over 16M colors! It is a community edition linux based smartphone, priced at a very reasonable $150. It has a normal screen size of 5.95 inches, and it runs Plasma Mobile OS. It's CPU is a quad-core 64 bit processor, and it’s GPU comes at 400MP2. Its internal Flash Memory comes to 16 GB and it’s system memory comes at 2 GB. They also conveniently come with a micro sd card slot, for an expansion of up to 2TB. There is a headphone jack on the phone and also a USB C output port on the bottom of the phone. One of the disappointing features about this is that there is only a maximum of 3000 mAh Battery, which is shorter compared to the competition. But it does have a Linux terminal and a Python IDE for all coders out there! All in all, this is a simplistic phone meant for programmers, not as a full on usage phone.</b></center></p>
        <h2><center style="font-size: 40px;">PlumPhone: Small Budget</center></h2>
        <img src="Plumphonefinal.png" style="height: 400px; width: 400px; margin-left: 460px;"/>
        <p><center><b>It seems like you were on a really small and tight budget ( Perhaps you blew your allowance all on candy? ). If you have, then this is the phone for you. It has an insane amount of 128 GB of Internal Memory in that tiny phone! It has a standard keypad ( It is slow for texting ), and 2 social media buttons ( pretty convenient for most of us), and a camera on the backside (Unusual for standard phones). It’s OS is Android and is an unlocked phone for SIM Cards. It comes with headphones and can expand up to 2TB with a microSD card expansion 9 Costs about $450, way more expensive than the phone itself ). To conclude, for the price it’s worth it.</b></center></p>
