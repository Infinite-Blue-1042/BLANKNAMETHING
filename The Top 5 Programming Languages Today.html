    <div id="para">
        <p><b>There are as many as 600 different programming languages out there today, but which ones are the best for you? Today, we will be selecting the top 5 programming languages out there today based on job availability, how easy they are, and what purpose they serve.</b></p>
        <h2><center  style="font-size: 40px;">5. Java/Kotlin</center></h2>
        <img src="javafinal.png" style="height: 300px; width: 300px; margin-left: 500px;"/>
        <p><b>Java is a front and back-end language that is similar to Python in that it is better for back-end. It was released in 1996 and the latest release is Java 16. Java was very popular, and Python took itâ€™s spot in the programming world. Although Python is more popular, many websites still use Java and it is still a popular language. Google released Kotlin, a variant of Java that makes Java coding easier. Google lets programmers use Java and Kotlin to develop mobile apps for their app store. Google has brought Kotlin and Java alive. In regards to job opportunities, Java has been reduced in popularity, along with Kotlin. Java is a little difficult to learn and some programming knowledge is required (I recommend Python first and then Java, if you want to go into mobile apps).</b></p>
        <h2><center  style="font-size: 40px;">4. Dart</center></h2>
        <img src="dartfinal.png" style="height: 300px; width: 300px; margin-left: 500px;"/> 
        <p><b>Dart is a programming language developed by google and it is mainly used for building IOS and Android apps. It is an incredibly fast programming language and is native to many Operating Systems. In rare cases it can also be used for website and full-stack development. It is also easily usable on ARM x64 machines, which is very common with this open source architecture. The language itself is very similar to the Java and C++ Programming language, and they do say that themselves. There is a high demand in the industry for this because more and more companies want fast and professional apps for their customers, and dart sloves that. The concept of dart is simple and the syntax is also relatively easy but, but the implementation is the hardest part.</b></p>
        <h2><center  style="font-size: 40px;">3. C++</center></h2>
        <img src="C++.png" style="height: 300px; width: 300px; margin-left: 500px;"/>
        <p><b>C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. C++ supports different ways of programming like procedural, object-oriented, functional, and so on. This makes C++ powerful as well as flexible. There is also a variant of C++ called the Arduino Programming Language. It can be used to control Leds, Buttons, and a variety of sensors. This can be implemented in a variety of applications such as robot controlling, industry level manufacturing, and simple hobbyist projects such as 3d printers! There is not as high demand in the industry as there is not one major professional use of it, because it is easy to learn.</b></p>
        <h2><center  style="font-size: 40px;">2. Javascript</center></h2>
        <img src="javascfinal.png" style="height: 300px; width: 300px; margin-left: 500px;"/>
        <p><b>Javascript, or ECMAscript can be a front or a back-end programming language that pairs well with web development. It was released in 1997 and the latest release is the 11th edition. The trio of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is very common in web development and has many popular and different variants. If you are creating a website, there will often be a Javascript variant or a Javascript API like Node.js or React. The reason why Javascript is at the second and not the first spot, even with all of these great variants is that there are not as many job opportunities for Javascript now. Personally, I think that Javascript is also not as easy for beginners as there are many new techniques that require some programming knowledge.</b></p>
        <h2><center  style="font-size: 40px;">1. Python</center></h2>
        <img src="python.png" style="height: 300px; width: 300px; margin-left: 500px;"/>
        <p><b>Python is a typically back-end programming language that has quickly gained popularity. It was released in 1991 and the latest current stable version of Python is 3.9.0.  It is an easy language to grasp, and does not require any experience in programming. Python can be doubled with many modules and can be used for multiple uses, such as building a game with the Pygame module or styling your code with frameworks such as Flask and Django. Python is used as a back-end language in many websites such as Google. Since Python has risen in popularity, there have been more job positions and offers for Python and its frameworks. If you are looking for your first language, Python is one of the best to start with.</b></p>
